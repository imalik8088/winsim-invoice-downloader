# Invoice Downloader for Winsim 

Winsim.de sends me once a month an info mail about the newly added invoice but does not attach the invoice and therefore one has to log in and download the invoice.
This scrapy script helps to download the invoice and save it to local directory. This can be extended for other vendors
